    <div class="container-lirik">
        <p class="lirik">You worried 'bout leaving a better planet for our kids
            How 'bout leaving better kids for our planet
            Entire generation offended at everything
            Getting mad that a human thinks all lives matter
            We don't need black or white or left or right
            What we need is common sense, we need balance
            We're all in the same boat, why you tryna make holes?
            If they sink, we sink, this is madness
            I'm offended that you're offended by me taking offense
            Trump can't build a wall, why does your house have a fence?
            I believe in two genders, I'm not mad at the rest
            I'm just confused when a dude has a beard and some breasts
            We won't always agree, no
            I don't hate all police, no
            I don't think that the system's racist
            I just think the system hates people
            I think fighting violence with more violence is what they want
            Viruses and riots, people dying, we won't stay home
            Black lives matter, all lives matter, what's all this division for?
            It's modern segregation, this is setting up a civil war
            Burn the circus down 'cause the world is full of clowns
            They're all stupid and they're proud, making smiles on they mouths
            I don't hang with Bozos, homie, I can't be around you
            Anyone who knows me, knows my feet don't fit in clown shoes
            When I was a child, the only races that we hated
            Were the ones that we ran and didn't win
            Then we stopped playing with each other, started hating on each other
            Started noticing the color of our skin
            Christians and atheists, immigrants, patriots
            We love the country but we are not saving it
            Wages don't raise through the rate of inflation
            And half of the country hates all of the nation, it's
            Funny that we think the world owes us something
            All the phones got smart but the people so dumb
            We care more about the likes and our selfies than our moms
            And the only time we ever speak the truth's when we're drunk
            We won't always agree, no
            I don't hate all police, no
            Your thoughts and opinions ain't facts
            And they are not defining my reality, no
            I think picking sides divides, it's probably what has got us here
            United States is great regardless, that's what we forgot in here
            Black lives matter, all lives matter, what's all this division for
            It's modern segregation, this is setting up a civil war
            Burn this circus down 'cause the world is full of clowns
            They're all stupid and they're proud, painted smiles on they mouths
            I don't hang with bozos, homie, I can't be around you
            Anyone who knows me knows my feet don't fit in clown shoes
            They tell you, "Be yourself", and then they judge you on the internet
            Till everybody hates you for it
            If Jesus was alive, I swear to God that y'all would cancel him
            'Cause lately being negative's the real new normal, yeah
            If you're thick, you're fat, you're rich, you're bad
            You're poor, you're black, you're white, you're whack, they lie, it's facts
            My generation needs a bunch of free condoms
            'Cause common sense ain't that common
            This is what they wanted, this is how they planned it
            This is to control everyone on the planet
            Then we put each other in caskets, protest in panic
            And they take advantage to manage the damage
            We won't always agree, no
            Freedom doesn't come free, no
            There was people fighting, dying overseas
            So that you could have freedom and be home
            I think the elites are real but they ain't drinking babies' blood
            They're creating chaos so they have something to save you from
            Black lives matter, all lives matter, what's all this division for?
            It's modern segregation, this is setting up a civil war
            Burn this circus down 'cause the world is full of clowns
            They're all stupid and they're proud, painted smiles on they mouths
            I don't hang with bozos, homie, I can't be around you
            Anyone who knows me knows my feet don't fit in clown shoes

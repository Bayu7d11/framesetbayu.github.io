    <h1>Calum Scott - You are the reason</h1>
    <div class="container-lirik">
        <p class="lirik">There goes my heart beating
            'Cause you are the reason
            I'm losing my sleep
            Please come back now
            And there goes my mind racing
            And you are the reason
            That I'm still breathing
            I'm hopeless now
            I'd climb every mountain
            And swim every ocean
            Just to be with you
            And fix what I've broken
            Oh, 'cause I need you to see
            That you are the reason
            There goes my hands shaking
            And you are the reason
            My heart keeps bleeding
            I need you now
            And if I could turn back the clock
            I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
            I'd spend every hour, of every day
            Keeping you safe
            And I'd climb every mountain
            And swim every ocean
            Just to be with you
            And fix what I've broken
            Oh, 'cause I need you to see
            That you are the reason
            I don't wanna fight no more
            I don't wanna hide no more
            I don't wanna cry no more
            Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)
            Be a little closer now
            Just a little closer now
            Come a little closer
            I need you to hold me tonight
            I'd climb every mountain
            And swim every ocean
            Just to be with you
            And fix what I've broken
            'Cause I need you to see
            That you are the reason
            </p>
